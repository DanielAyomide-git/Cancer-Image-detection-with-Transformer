## **Project Roadmap & Phases**  

### ✅ **Phase 1: File Organization** (Current Phase)  
- **Sort project files into** `frontend/` and `backend/` folders.  
- Clean up code structure for better maintainability.  

### 🚀 **Phase 2: Backend Migration (Flask → FastAPI)**  
- **Replace Flask with FastAPI** for better performance and async support.  
- Update API routes and documentation using **Swagger (FastAPI's built-in UI)**.  
- Ensure smooth integration with the frontend.  

### 🌐 **Phase 3: Frontend Upgrade (React.js or Angular)**  
- **Migrate from HTML, CSS, and JS** to **React.js or Angular** for a modern UI.  
- Improve UX/UI for better user interaction.  
- Implement **state management (Redux or Context API for React / NgRx for Angular).**  

### 🔥 **Phase 4: Open Source Healthcare AI (Future Goal)**  
- Make the project **open-source** for community contributions.  
- Enhance the model with **more medical imaging datasets**.  
- Deploy the AI as a **REST API** for integration with other healthcare applications.
